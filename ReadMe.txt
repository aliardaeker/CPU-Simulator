Simulation Program to realize an out-of-order write-back, out-of-order issue CPU with 10 stages. 

Execute stage is parallelized into 3 way. 4 pipelined division unit, 2 multiplication unit, 1 integer function unit. Commits to architecture registers are done via a ROB. Memory access is done with LSQ and Issue Queue is used to issue multiple instructions at a time. 

Renaming is used with a physical register file to eliminate anti and output dependencies. Far most my favorite work. Written from scratch with a C format but should be compile with g++ to enable vector data structures. Any contribution is highly appreciated.
